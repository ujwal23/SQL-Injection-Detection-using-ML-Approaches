# üß† SQL Injection Detection using Machine Learning Approaches

A machine learning‚Äìbased system designed to **detect SQL Injection (SQLi) attacks** from user inputs and web requests.  
The project applies supervised learning and deep learning models to classify whether given input data is malicious (SQLi) or safe, strengthening web application security.

## üöÄ Features

- Detects SQL Injection payloads using ML classification  
- Compares multiple algorithms to identify the most accurate model  
- Employs **Count Vectorization** for text feature extraction  
- Uses labeled datasets from Kaggle containing SQL and non-SQL sentences  
- Evaluates performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Demonstrates a working example where user input is classified in real time

## üß© Machine Learning Models Used

| Category | Model | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Probabilistic Model** | **Na√Øve Bayes** | Uses Bayes‚Äô theorem to classify input text as SQL or non-SQL based on feature likelihoods. |
| **Instance-Based Model** | **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** | Classifies input text by measuring similarity (Euclidean distance) to known labeled data. |
| **Tree-Based Model** | **Decision Tree** | Splits data hierarchically to decide whether input patterns indicate SQL injection. |
| **Margin-Based Model** | **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** | Finds the optimal separating hyperplane to classify SQLi vs. safe inputs. |
| **Statistical Model** | **Logistic Regression** | Predicts probability of input belonging to SQLi class using the sigmoid function. |
| **Deep Learning Model** | **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** | Extracts spatial patterns from text embeddings using convolutional and pooling layers; provides the highest accuracy. |

## üß† Methodology Overview

1. **Data Collection** ‚Äì SQL Injection dataset (Kaggle) with 4200 labeled sentences  
   - Label `1`: SQL Injection  
   - Label `0`: Safe input  
2. **Data Preprocessing** ‚Äì  
   - Removal of NULL values and duplicates  
   - Tokenization and text cleaning  
3. **Vectorization** ‚Äì  
   - Using `CountVectorizer` (Bag-of-Words) to convert sentences into numerical features  
4. **Data Split** ‚Äì  
   - 80% training, 20% testing for generalization  
5. **Model Training** ‚Äì  
   - Train all six supervised models  
   - Hyperparameter tuning (epochs, batch size for CNN)  
6. **Evaluation** ‚Äì  
   - Compare all models using `accuracy`, `precision`, `recall`, and `F1-score`

## üìà Evaluation Metrics

The models were evaluated using:

- **Accuracy:** Percentage of correct predictions  
- **Precision:** Ratio of true positives to total predicted positives  
- **Recall:** Ratio of true positives to all actual positives  
- **F1-Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall  

**CNN achieved the highest F1-Score and precision**, showing strong robustness in differentiating SQLi strings from safe text.
